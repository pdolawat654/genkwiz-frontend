    "Berty Ashley was born and brought up in the ancient Tamil city of Madurai. From the day started to speak, he was known for his insatiable curiosity and inexpendable energy. An alumnus of Vikaasa school and The American College, he followed his dreams of becoming a scientist. <br /> <br />He is now a Molecular Geneticist at the Dystrophy Annihilation Research Trust (a.k.a DART). DART is the only parent-run scientific organization in the world which has the ability to make artificial DNA. At DART, Berty and other scientists work on cutting-edge technology to design, synthesize and validate personalized genetic therapy for children suffering from rare genetic disorders such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In 2020 DART became the first organization in the country to get permission to do a clinical trial on genetic therapy in India, and Berty and his team are eagerly awaiting the results from the trial in progress. <br /> <br />When he is not busy doing his research or write grants he can be usually seen at a concert or at a quiz. Berty is an avid lover of music who not only collects vinyl records but plays with 3 bands. He plays the guitar, keyboards and drums. He listens to everything from Hindustani to Heavy Metal. <br /> <br />Berty has been taking part and conducting quizzes since his school days. The love for trivia and funda made him develop his own characteristic quizzing style in which he infuses his trademark humour and pop-culture references. A childhood dream came true when Siddarth Basu who is known as the Godfather of Quizzing in India invited him to be the senior content editor for the south Indian version of Kaun Banega Crorepati where he was responsible for making the questions and ensuring their facts are correct. <br /> <br />He is the author of the popular 'Easy Like Sunday Morning' quiz in the Hindu Sunday Magazine which is renowned for the work-out-ability factor. It is currently on a run of unbroken weekly quizzes for six and a half years.  In early 2018 Rupa Publications published a collection of 42 of these quizzes under the name ‘quizzes for Quirky Minds' which in 1 week became best-seller in its category on Amazon. The book not only contains the quizzes but also his own jokes, anecdotes from his life and some random information such as recipes! Berty and his partner Akhila Phadnis have gone on to co-author a series of 7 quiz books on various themes for Rupa Publications. <br /> <br />Berty is a coffee lover who at any time is ready for a hot cup of filter coffee. This was established firmly when he and his team won the first India Coffee Board Coffee Quiz. <br /> <br />Some of the corporate for which he has brought in his own brand of entertaining quizzes are TCS, Union Bank of India, CISCO, Acko Insurance, Blue Star Pvt Ltd, L&T and he enjoys hosting sci-com quizzes for IISc, NCBS, Science Gallery Bengaluru and the Bangalore Tech Summit.He is known for his fun and work-outable quizzes which are usually filled with puns and jokes (just like in his book!). Berty Ashley puts the 'fun' in 'funda'.<br /><br />For more details: <a href='http://linktr.ee/bertyas' target='_blank'>http://linktr.ee/bertyas</a>",
